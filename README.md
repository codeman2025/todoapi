# Todo API & Live Demo

Welcome to the **Todo API** project â€” a lightweight RESTful API for managing todos, plus a clean, modern frontend demo.

Check out the live demo here:  
[https://codeman2025.github.io/todoapi](https://codeman2025.github.io/todoapi)

---

## Features

- Simple REST API for creating, listing, and deleting todos  
- Secure and minimal backend built with Express and CORS  
- Live frontend demo to interact with the API in real-time

---

## Using the API

Use the API directly via the hosted URL or your own deployment (if allowed).

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Description              | Request Body               |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/todos`       | Retrieve all todo items  | None                       |
| POST   | `/api/todos`       | Create a new todo item   | `{ "task": "Your task" }`  |
| DELETE | `/api/todos/:id`   | Delete a todo by its ID  | None                       |

## Example Frontend

The example site lets you:

- Delete todos  

**Note:** The example is configured to use the hosted API URL. Update `API_BASE` inside `index.html` if needed.
